        How I Picked These 8 Best Blogging Platforms
When I started blogging, I made the classic beginner's mistake: I chose a platform based solely on its free plan and basic customization options. As my blog grew, my needs changed dramatically. I found myself migrating between platformsâ€”a process that's about as fun as moving apartments. Three platform switches later, I've learned what really matters when choosing a blogging home.

To save you from the same platform-hopping headache, I've created a careful selection process based on real blogging growth. Here's what I specifically looked for:

Ease of Use: How quickly could I get from sign-up to publishing? I tested each platform's editor and basic features without consulting help docs to gauge true user-friendliness.
Value for Money: Rather than just looking at price tags, I evaluated what you actually get for your investment. This meant comparing features across different pricing tiers and checking for hidden costs.
